# Lightroom-JPEG-Selector

This repository simplifies the process of selecting the *original JPEG* from your picked RAW files in Lightroom.

Usually photographers have RAW format for the highest quality, but sometimes, they just want to keep some of them as JPEGs, especially for those impromptu shots that don't require heavy editing. In many cases, the original JPEG generated by the camera is sufficient.

Sadly, when using Lightroom, there’s a catch: although you can see the JPEG version of a photo in the preview, when exporting a batch, Lightroom only provides the RAW file or a RAW-like JPEG—without the original JPEG from the camera.

This tool is to help you easily export a batch of the original jpeg version of your picked/ranked/colored raws.

P.S. You still need to import the original JPEGs when you import your RAW files. RAW files include an embedded JPEG for preview purposes, but this tool specifically uses the existing JPEG with the same name as your selected RAW files instead of extracting it from the RAW.
